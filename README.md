homework 15



The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

The provided JavaScript code uses the Leaflet and D3 libraries to create an interactive map visualizing earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Here's a simplified breakdown:

1. **Tile Layers:** Define different map styles (streets, satellite, grayscale, outdoors) using Leaflet tile layers.

2. **Map Object:** Create a Leaflet map object with a specified center, zoom level, and initial layer (satellite).

3. **Basemaps and Overlays:** Define basemaps and overlays in dictionaries (`baseMaps` and `overlays`). Add a control layer to toggle between them.

4. **Styling Functions:** Create functions (`styleInfo` and `chooseColor`) to determine the style (color, radius, fillColor) of earthquake markers based on their properties.

5. **Data Loading:** Use D3 to load earthquake data asynchronously from a GeoJSON URL. Add the data to the map as circle markers with popups.

6. **Tectonic Plates Data:** Load tectonic plate data asynchronously using D3. Draw purple lines over the plates and add them to the map.

7. **Legend Creation:** Create a legend using the Leaflet control class. Add HTML content representing legend items for different depth ranges.

8. **Legend Addition:** Add the legend to the bottom-right corner of the map.

To implement this code, include Leaflet and D3 libraries in your HTML file, create a `<div>` with an id of "map," and include the script containing this JavaScript code. Ensure your HTML references the required libraries. The code aims to help the USGS visualize earthquake data for public education and awareness.
